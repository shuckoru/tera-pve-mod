# Tera PVE Mod

This module is designed to provide various QoL improvements, especially for pve content, in the game TERA.

No SP manipulation of any kind is, nor will it ever be, present in this mod. These mods are not intended to give the player any advantage whatsoever, they're all just useful QoL improvements.

Currently mostly optimized for [MT: The Dream's server](https://discord.gg/mtdream) and Brawlers (because that's what I play). But it should still work on other servers and other classes just fine.

These mods are designed to be safe to use in all normal scenarios, but I take no responsibilities on the way you choose to use them. Modifying its code could result in unfair advantages and therefore in bans. Use at your own risk.

Warning:  
The default settings experience with this mod should never cause you any issues. Modifications of settings could however be unsafe so use at your own risk. (eg. Hiding certain abnorms could give you unfair advantages in game, especially in PvP, so be careful when you add abnorms to the hidden list)

## Installation

1. clone the repo in /mods folder of toolbox
2. launch the game

## Usage

The module provides several commands that can be used in the game. Find the updated list using '/8 help' command in game.

Eventually I will introduce a gui to adjust all of these settings. Stay tuned for that.

## Features

Some of the features included:

- DPS Meter: Measures and displays the Damage Per Second (DPS) output of the player and the party.
- Fight Timer: Tracks the duration of the fight.
- Abnormalities Hide: Increases in-game FPS and decreases buff/debuffs bar clutter by not processing useless abnorms on your character & boss.
- Fight DPS Auto Paste: Automatically pastes the details of the fight in the party chat.
- Burn Reminder: Sends a reminder to properly sync your 'Burn' every minute.
- Battle Notify: Alerts when certain events happen, like dps using burn, buffs/debuffs running out, etc
- Battle Stats: Track useful fight stats (some new like Meta Sync for healer and tank)
- Hide Motes: Hide Mystic motes in the ground
- Small Dmg Numbers: Simplifies damage dealt to be easier to read
- NPCs Anywhere: Open NPCs windows anywhere (broker, banker, etc)
- JustSpamF: Just Spam F instead of clicking NPCs buttons
- Apply Inspect: Queries Teralogs to see the DPS of the person who just applied

If you feel like other utilities could be useful to be added, open an issue and I'll process the requests asap!
